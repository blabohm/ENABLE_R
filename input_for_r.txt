The following files are required by the skript and have to be stored in directory "city-name/input/"

1. City center point as a .shp file
	center_city-name.shp

2. Distance layers to be produced in QGIS (The raster::distance() function takes way too long to process):

	d2_transport.tif
	Distance of city area to transport lines (classes 12210 and 12220).

	d2_densres.tif
	Distance of city area to dense residential classes (classes 11100, 11210 and 11220).

3. Land use change and protect files:

	LU_change.tif
	Areas that already changed, thus are unlikely to change again
	
	LU_protect.tif
	Areas that won't change due to different reasons
